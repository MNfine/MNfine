# Welcome â€” I'm MNfine

Hi, I'm a builder at heart â€” passionate about creating things that solve real problems. Iâ€™m working at the intersection of **technology**, **AI**, and **entrepreneurship**, with a mission to turn ideas into useful, scalable products.

---

## About Me

As someone driven by a startup mindset, I believe in **rapid prototyping**, **iteration**, and delivering **practical impact**. Iâ€™m especially focused on applying **AI** â€” not just as a trend, but as a tool to unlock real-world value.

My work is about:
- Turning concepts into MVPs and demos
- Using AI to automate, enhance, and simplify user experiences
- Creating tools that people _actually_ want to use â€” in education, legal tech, and beyond

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring:
- **Legal AI** in Vietnam using RAG (Redis + OpenAI)
- **Lightweight systems development** to understand how machines work
- Building toward a future where AI-powered tools become affordable and meaningful for everyone
